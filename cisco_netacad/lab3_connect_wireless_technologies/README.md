# Part 1: Connecting a Laptop to the Office WLAN

## Installing the Wireless Module
To connect the laptop wirelessly, I powered the laptop off, removed the Ethernet module, and installed the WPC300N wireless module.  
Then I powered the laptop back on.

## Connecting to the WLAN
I went to **Desktop → PC Wireless** and scanned for available networks.  
I selected the **Employee** SSID, entered the key **Cisco123**, and connected.  
After that, I verified the laptop received an IP address under **Wireless0**.  
I tested the connection by navigating to **office.srv** in the web browser.
